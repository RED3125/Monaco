	<h1>MONACO</h1>
	<p>The Principality of Monaco is a dwarf state on the coast of the Ligurian Sea, receiving almost a million tourists a year. Despite its more than modest size – the country's area fits into a ridiculous 2 km2 – Monaco looks incredibly respectable and glossy. Ports full to overflowing with snow-white yachts, a bunch of serious banks that attract money from all over Europe, and a well-established mechanism of tourist infrastructure help the local population to live in a big way, not denying themselves anything.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>AREA - 2 km2</li>
		<li>POPULATION - 38 350 persons</li>
		<li>LANGUAGE - Français </li>
